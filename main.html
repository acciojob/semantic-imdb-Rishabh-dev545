            Inception is a science fiction action film where Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in the art of extraction, steals valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased in exchange for implanting another person's idea into a target's subconscious â€” a process called inception.
